# Library-Managment-Flask
This is a mini library management project as the university project.
We have a first admin that can promote other usual users to admin.
We have a login form with a forgot password link that sends a link to your email for password reseting and a register form.
Admins can add and delete a book and edit it's infos which include picture file,name,author and etc and they can borrow books as well.
We have price for our books and user money and book quantity for fun that changes when we borrow books.
On the home route of the site we can see pages of books posted and we can find book datas by clicking on their names.
It goes to the book's page where we can borrow it and delete and edit it(if we are admin user).
We have a account page as well where we see and edit our account data such as username , email and profile picture.
